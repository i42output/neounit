# neounit
Free C++ unit of measurement (UoM) library (permissive software license).

Features:

* Header only with no dependencies on external libraries.
* "std::ratio on steroids" implementation: effectively no limit on unit multiple supporting all SI unit prefixes.

**NOTE**: This new project is, as of September 2023, still a work-in-progress so **DO NOT USE** until v1.0 has been released with a full suite of unit tests.
